# Weather App

An application that shows the weather of a location.
It uses APIs to fetch data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current), like location, temperatures, humidity, etc...
The main goal of this is to improve my skill with APIs and build knowledge and gain more confidence with my asynchronous javascript skills
